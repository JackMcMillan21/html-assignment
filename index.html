    <h2>Flight System</h1>

    <p>This website is going to be used to track your recent flight history and other information relating to your travel you have taken.
        Some things that you will notice are on this website are tables including past flights from destination to destination, 
        images of the places you have travelled to, the website you used to book all of the flights, and input for planning your next trip!

    <!-- This Portion of code is the photos that are presensented on the website. I have the width set to 33% so it will adjust better on screen sizes 
        and the images will always be beside one another and never on top of eachother,but the height set to 400 because that is harder to maintain.-->
